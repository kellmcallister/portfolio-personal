      <h3 class="about-paragraph-title">Builder of homes and homepages</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I've always been a builder, tinkerer, creator from childhood sandcastles
        and Lego mansions to a Geocities webpage back in the 90s. In high
        school, I obsessed over having the best protected egg drop design (my
        lunchroom straw helicopter took all ðŸ¥‡) or the fastest CO2 racecar in
        woodshop.

          I'm confident the 4th layer of ultra-slick fingernail polish is what
          made it fashionably aerodynamic.</em

        Upon taking AutoCAD classes, I found my digital builder calling. I
        started with designing basic widgets and progressed to house floorplans.
        In a class competition I designed and drafted a floorplan in
        Architectural Desktop then made a 3D model out of foamboard where both
        the roof and second story were removable for added visualization. These
        classes positioned me for a college entrance in the civil engineering
        field.

        A fierce Iowa State Cyclone fan and dual-alumni
      </h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        At Iowa State, I started my Civil Engineering journey in 2003. While the
        engineering classes were very challenging, I excelled in noticing
        patterns and focusing on understanding the 'why' of how it all came
        together. Throughout college I explored career paths through 3 different
        internships: working in the cartography/digital maps department at the
        Iowa DOT, as a Field Engineer with American Constructors in Austin, and
        a Construction Manager with Stanley Consultants in Iowa. I was lucky to
        have these real-world experiences as they helped me determine that upon
        graduation I wanted to be primarily in the field as opposed to the
        office. I also intended to move somewhere without regular snowfall (you
        don't have to shovel sunshine! ðŸŒž)
        <br /><br />During my sophomore year at ISU I was lucky to spend a
        semester studying abroad in Newcastle, NSW Australia. It was 6 months of
        making new friends, attending classes at the Callaghan campus, traveling
        on long weekends, and exploring a new world. <br /><br />In 2006 I was
        accepted as an MBA candidate, participating in the inaugural concurrent
        Civil Engr/MBA program. For two years I dove into case studies,
        presentations, and lengthy in-class debates dissecting real-world
        business strategy scenarios and problem-solving techniques.

        Austin, Texas: the land of cowboy boots and Mexican martinis
      </h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        I had earned a full-time position as a Project Engineer with my dream
        contractor, DPR Construction. I liked that the company was
        forward-thinking and elevating the innovation status of a predominantly
        archaic industry. We had trainings on Google Sketchup and Revit, and
        general BIM practices. Despite my enjoyment of this role, the economy in
        2009 had other plans for me, and downgraded me to the unemployment
        list.<br /><br />
        After many months of searching I was hired by JC Evans, a heavy highway
        and utility general contractor. I worked on 2 TXDOT projects in Ennis
        and Waco, Texas, building 18 miles of highway and 12 bridges. Late-night
        concrete pours of bridge decks were my favorite. Unfortunately, JCE also
        struggled in the state of the economy and I moved back to the interior
        finish division with a different builder, Harvey-Cleary.
        <br /><br />Throughout my time at HCB I worked on some really fun
        interior buildouts, including a Whole Foods IT office-space with
        creative murals, and a LEED certified data center/warehouse for HID,
        among many others. <br /><br />After my time at HCB I entered the world
        of residential construction, working in supply chain for one of the
        nation's largest homebuilders, PulteGroup. Over 8 years I managed over
        50+ trades and contributed to the builds of roughly 9,000 homes in
        Central Texas. My favorite parts were working with designers and
        manufactures to hand-pick the finish programs of flooring, countertops,
        etc. that new homeowners would choose to personalize their home. It was
        exciting to see the style trends change with time, as well as the
        innovations.

      <h3 class="about-paragraph-title">In my spare time</h3>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Outside the M-F 9-5 you'll find me planning trips with my girlfriends to
        go hiking, try new restaurants, and partake in a historical ghost tour.
        I've been lucky to travel the world and some of my favorite countries
        are New Zealand, Scotland, and Italy. I haven't yet been everywhere, but
        it's on my list.<br />
        <br />I'm often found in a plush chair with black coffee or red wine (or
        both!) nestled in a good book. My 2023 goal is to read 50 books and I'm
        making great progress so far. <br /><br />
        My newest learning-quest has been the
        <a href="https://www.shecodes.io" target="_blank" class="shecodes-link"
          >SheCodes coding bootcamp workshops</a
        >, started in January 2023. While challenging, coding has sparked my
        creativity and puzzle-oriented brain and I hope to expand on my
        front-end developer resume in the future. Check out my
        <a href="/coding.html" class="shecodes-link">Coding page</a> to see my
